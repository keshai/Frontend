Q1. what is function and why we need func in programming ?
-> What is a Function?
    A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task or operation.
    It has a name, can take input parameters, and may return a value.
    Functions allow you to encapsulate logic and reuse it throughout your program.

-> Why Do We Need Functions?
    Modularity:
        Functions break down a large program into smaller, manageable pieces (modules).
        Each function focuses on a specific task, making code easier to understand and maintain.
    Code Reusability:
        Once you define a function, you can call it multiple times from different parts of your program.
        No need to duplicate code; just reuse the function.

Q2. how many types of func in javsScript ?
three types -> naming -> jinka naam hota hai -> with name and with funct name
            -> anomynous - > jinka naam nhi hota -> use in callback (), hooks -> only func name
            -> arrow -> syntax ' => ' -> very usefull -> complex function 15 lines ko 2-4 lines me end kar dega.
->Named Functions:
    Definition:
        Named functions have a specific name or identifier.
        You declare them using the function keyword followed by a name. 
    Usage:
        Named functions are useful when you want to reference the function multiple times in your code.
        They can be called by their name and reused throughout your program.

->Anonymous Functions:
    Definition:
        Anonymous functions do not have a name.
        They are declared without an identifier.
    Usage:
        Often used as callbacks or event handlers.
        Stored in variables or passed directly as arguments to other functions.
    
-> Arrow Functions:
    Definition:
        Arrow functions are always anonymous (they don’t have a name).
        You declare them using the “fat arrow” syntax (=>).
    Usage:
        Often used for concise one-liners or as callbacks.
        Useful when you want to keep the code compact.


Q3. differ betw naming func and annomynous func ?
-> previous question me hai bhai.

Q4. argument vs parameter ?
-> Parameters:
    Definition:
        Parameters are placeholders or variables defined in the function declaration or definition.
        They act as input slots for values that the function expects.
    Usage:
        Parameters are used within the function body to perform operations.
        They represent the expected data that the function will work with.
-> Arguments:
    Definition:
        Arguments are the actual values passed to a function when it is called.
        They fill in the placeholders (parameters) defined in the function.
    Usage:
        Arguments are provided during the function call.
        They supply the specific data that the function will process.
-> In summary:
        Parameters are part of the function definition.
        Arguments are part of the function call.
        Remember, parameters define what a function expects, and arguments provide the actual data! 

Q5. why we need return keyword in func ?
 -> When a function encounters a return statement, it immediately exits.
    This helps control the flow of execution.

q6. how many value return from 1, one func ?

Q7. how many type of func in programming ?

Q8. what is  Closure and why we need this ?
