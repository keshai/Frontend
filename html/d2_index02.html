    <P>Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management¹²³⁴⁵. Web development can be classified into two ways: Frontend Development and Backend Development¹. 

        **Frontend Development** refers to the part of a website where the user interacts directly. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. The technologies used in frontend development include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap¹.
        
        **Backend Development** is the server side of a website. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and arrange data. The technologies used in backend development include PHP, Java, Python, and Node.js¹.
        
        If you are interested in learning more about web development, you can explore the roadmap of web development courses, tutorials, and projects on GeeksforGeeks¹.

      <center><H2>WHAT IS FRONTEND -</H2></center>
      <center><img src="frontend.avif" alt=""  width="250px"></center>
      <p>Frontend Development is the part of a website that the user interacts with directly. It is also known as the ‘client side’ of the application. The main responsibility of a Frontend Developer is to create the user interface, which includes designing and developing the layout, look, and feel of the website. The technologies used in frontend development include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap </p>
    
      <center><h2>WHAT IS BACKEND</h2></center>
      <center><img src="backend.jpg" alt=""  width="250px"></center>
      <P> Backend Development is the part of a website that the user does not interact with directly. It is also known as the ‘server side’ of the application. The main responsibility of a Backend Developer is to create and maintain the server-side of the website, which includes managing databases, APIs, and servers. The technologies used in backend development include PHP, Java, Python, and Node.js  </P>

      <center><H2>WHAT IS API</H2></center>
      <center><img src="api.jpg" alt=""  width="250px"></center>
      <P>API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other 12345. An API can be accessed using different protocols such as HTTP, SOAP, or JSON.

        To understand the concept of an API, let’s take a real-life example. Imagine you are at a restaurant and you want to order food. You tell the waiter what you want, and the waiter takes your order to the kitchen. The kitchen prepares the food and gives it to the waiter, who then brings it back to you. In this scenario, the waiter is the API, and the kitchen is the server that provides the service.
        
        APIs are used extensively in software development to implement various features by using an API call without writing complex codes for the same. A developer can create an API for an operating system, database system, hardware system, JavaScript file, or similar object-oriented files </P>

        <center><h3>WHAT IS HTML</h3></center>
        <center> <img src="html.jpg" alt=""  width="250px"></center>
        <P>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is the standard markup language for creating web pages. HTML is used to describe the structure of a web page and its content. It consists of a series of elements that label pieces of content such as “this is a heading”, “this is a paragraph”, “this is a link”, etc</P>
        
       <center><H3>WHAT IS 'UTF-8'-</H3></center>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <P>UTF-8 is a character encoding standard that is used to represent text in a way that can be transmitted over the internet. It is a variable-length character encoding that defines all the characters needed for writing the majority of living languages in use on computers. UTF-8 is the default character set in HTML5 and the preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages.

            UTF-8 is a superset of ASCII, which means that the first 128 characters of UTF-8 have the same binary values as ASCII, making ASCII text valid UTF-8. UTF-8 can be implemented by different character sets. The most commonly used encodings are UTF-8 and UTF-16.
